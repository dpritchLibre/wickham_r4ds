* Workflow: basics

1. Why does this code not work?

#+BEGIN_SRC R
my_variable <- 10
my_varÄ±able
#+END_SRC

There is a non-ASCII character in the second line after the ~r~ character that
looks like an ~i~ but is in fact something else.


2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
#+END_SRC

In the call to ~ggplot~ there is a typo: ~dota~ should be ~data~.  Then the next
expression has two typos: ~fliter~ should be ~filter~, and ~cyl = 8~ should be
~cyl == 8~.  Additionally, the second call to ~filter~ needs uses the ~diamonds~
dataset without loading it first.  The revised code is shown below.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)

data(diamonds)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
#+END_SRC


3.  Press ~Alt-Shift-K~.  What happens?  How can you get to the same place using
    the menus?
